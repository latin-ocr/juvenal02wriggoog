Nero pillaged Italy and the prov-

the vast amounts 01 gold that had
accumulated in the temples at
Rome, and in Greece and Asia,
taking off even the images 01 the
gods. Suetonius, Ner. 32, says

addressed, had entrusted a deposit
01 10‚ooo sesterces (vs. 71) to a

a deposit was one 01 the five par-
ticular sins which the Christians
bound themselves by oath not to
