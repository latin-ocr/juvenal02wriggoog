SATVRA VII 79·

pelamydum aut veteres, Maurorum epimenia, bulbi 120
aut vinum Tiberi devectum, quinque lagonae.

si quater egisti, si contigit aureus unuS,

inde cadunt partes ex·ioedere pragmaticorum.

Aemilio dabitur quantum licet, et melius nos

egimus. huius enim stat currus aeneus, alti 125
quadriiuges in vestibulis, atque ipse feroci

bellatore sedens curvatum hastile minatur

eminus et statua meditatur proelia lusca.

120. epimenia, a month's pro-
ornans.

121. Tiberi devectum: in con-
trast with foreign and Campanian
wines, which were brought up the
Tiber. —lagonae : cf. 5. 29 n.

122. quater: εἰ. in an excep
tionally laborious case, bringing in
an actual fee in gold. -aureus : a
Roman gold coin. The aureus of
Augustus contained 126 grains of
gold, and was equivalent to about
five dollars That oi Nero con·
tarned only 112 grains of gold and
was worth proportionately less.

¹²3· pragmaticorum, attor-
neys; men skilled in law, who
gave legal advice but d1d not plead
The advocates were trained' 1n

rhetoric but might have little legal ·

knowledge3 hence they often de-
pended upon the pragmatici for
the points of law on which their
arguments were based3 cf. Quint.

124.3 Aemilio: any lawyer oi
wealth and position. Because he
is wealthyandinfluentialhisclients
expect to pay liberally for his ser-
vices-quantum licet, as much
as the law allows. By the lex
Cincio, uc. 204, a person was for·
bidden to receive money or a giit
for pleading a case. In the reign
of Claudius the law was so changed

that a iee not in excess oi 10,000 ·
sesterces might be taken; Tac·
Ann. XI. 5 and 7. Pliny (Ep. V.
13. 8) never received a fee or a
present ior pleading a case.

1²5· huius: to be joined with
in vestibulis. — currus: in which
some ancestor is represented 'as
riding in triumph; cf. 8. 3 stantis
in curribus Aemilzunos. - alti
quadriiuges, a statelylteam ‹y‘foun

126. ipse: Aemilius himself.-
ieroci bellatore sedens: cf.

Mart. IX. 68.6 causs'dimm medio .

cum saber‘uptut equo. The de-
scription is meant to be ludicrous.
A lawyer is represented mounted
on a spirited war horse charging
against an unseen enemy with a
crooked spear. The spear shaft
may have become bent by accident,
or by its own weight through lapse
of time and neglect.

128. eminus. as ii armmg at an
object a spear‘s throw distant.-
meditatur proelia, is practising
un attuck; ci. 4. 112. -lusca, one-
e y.ed Mayor says: ‘For certainty
of' arm one eye is closed’; but who
would have his own statue made
in that way? Friedliinder sug·
gests that the statue may have
been oi bronze with colored stones
for eyeballs, one oi which has
fallen out.
