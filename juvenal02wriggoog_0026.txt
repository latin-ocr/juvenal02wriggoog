18. Juvenal’s literary studies included Homer, Lucilius,
“ Vergil, Horace, Ovid, and Seneca, oi whom the satires con-

tain frequent* reminiscences. ln a iew cases he has admitted ,
their expressions with slight change into his verses,l though ε
’ he is by no means to be considered an imitator oi the older

poets. But between the writings of Juvenal and Martial
there are striking resemblances3 they treat often oi the
same subjects, many personal names are common to both,
and they employ many similar words and expressions.

They were intimate friends, but Martial was the earlier ⁴

writer. His epigrams were completed and published before
Juvenal had brought out his iirst book, and probably before
any oi the satires had been written. It seems evident, then,
that Juvenal was so familiar with the writings oi Martial
that his own language and thought were not infrequently

influenced bythem.² The two poets may well be read side ⁴

by side, since each furnishes the best illustrations and par-
allels to the other.

η. The best manuscript of Juvenal isone now preserved ⁸ χ

in the library oi the medical school in Montpellier, where it

is No. 12 5. It was once in the possession ol Pierre Pithon, '

whose edition oi Juvenal and Persius was published in

1585, and from him it is called Pithoeanus. This MS. con- ¹

tains the texts oi both Persius and Juvenal, with notes on
the margin (scholia Pithoeona). The first hand (P) belongs

to the ninth century. To this have been added corrections, l

variants, and glosses by four different hands from the ninth

lsee notes on r.73;3. 14333.198; 3.279; 5. 138; ¹⁰¹²5i 11.82.
