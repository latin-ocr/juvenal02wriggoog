15. Naturally, then, Juvenal has respect for the old ,
national faith and hates all foreign religions. He treats γ
with derision the Greek fables that represent the gods
in human form, with human necessities and weaknesses l
(13. 39-52‚ 833 14. 2⁰61, 271; 16. 5), and considers the Greek l
stories about the under-world too absurd even for children ³
to believe (2. 149-152). The Jewish worship, with its sab-
baths and prayer to an unseen god, he regards as a narrow-
minded foreign superstition (14. 96-106). But he speaks
with respect of a common creator (15. 148) and offers sacri· J
fices to Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, as well as to his own
Lares, for the safe return of his friend Catullus (12. 8 3—92).
He says with evident sincerity that man is dearer to the gods
than he is to himself (10. 350), that the gods have given
him a reverential spirit (15.143) and have placed in his ,
breast a conscience to scourge him when he does wrong
(13. 192-198). He believes that the gods will aveuge per-
jury and crime (13. 247-249), and affirms that hewho
cherishes even the wish to sin incurs the guilt of the deed
and will not escape punishment (13. 208-210).

16. Juvenal did not profess to have much acquaintance
with the philosophy of the schools (13. rao-123), but he
knew their main distinctions, and his sympathies were with

the Stoics rather than the Epicureans. Like the StoicS, he ¹

believed in the unchaugeable decrees of fate (7. 200 3 12. 6 3)
and the providential care of the gods (10. 347), and like
them he commended the endurance of hardship for its own
sake and a contempt of death (10. 3 57-362). But, in gen·
eraI, for him philosophy is simply the highest wisdom, which

shows man how to live. It frees us from our errors and ¹

teaches us what is right (13. 187-189), enables us to conquer
misfortune (13. 20), forbids revenge (13. 184-187), and is
