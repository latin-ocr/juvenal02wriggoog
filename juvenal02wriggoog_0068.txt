18 IVVENALIS

¹ nam quid tam miserum, tam solum vidimus, utnon
deterius credas horrere incendia, lapsus

tectorum adsiduos ac mille pericula saevae

urbis et Augusto recitantes mense poetas?

sed dum tota domus raeda componitur una,
substitit ad veteres arcus madidamque Capenam.

hic ubi nocturnae Numa constituebat amicae,
nunc sacri fontis nemus et delubra lpcaritpy
Iudaeis quorum cophinus faenumque supellex ;
omnis enim populo mercedem pendere iussa est
arbor et eiectis mendicat silva Camenis. '

jects mentioned here occupies the
last part ot the satire; incendia,

8. mille: rie. mille alia. For an
indefinitely large number Juvenal
often uses mille, but the earlier
sescenti once only (7. 178). - sae-
vae: cf. 1. 30 iniquae.

9. Augusto recitantes: put
last to complete the climax, as it
all other evils were light compared
with this. Juvenal was an unwill-
ing listenerin any seas0n3 cf. 1.1n.

10-20. While his goods are
being stowed away in the raeda,
in which he is to make his journey‚
Umbricius stops near the Porta
Capena, aud goes with Juvenal
down to the valle of Egeria, which
is now profaned by beggars.

10. raedae a strong four-
wheeled wagon, of Gallie origin,
drawn by two or tour homes, and
used to transport both passengers
and baggage; ci. Hor. S. I. 5. 86.
With some exceptions wagons
were not allowed in the city be-
tween sunrise and the tenth hour
of the day. But, as vs. 316 shows,
’ Umbricius sets out just before

sunset. The wagon, therefore,

may have been loaded at the gate, ἶ
or, late in the asternoon, in the ᾗ
city near the house where Umbri· l

cius had lodged.

11. veteresarcus :the arches ot
the gata—Capenam: the Porta
Capena was agate in the Servian

wall at which the Via Appia began. ’

It is called madidam from the

dripping ol an aqueduct, the Aqua κ
Murcia, which was carried over it 3 r

cf. Mart. III. 47. 1 Capena grandi
porta qua pluit gutta

12. nocturnae constituebat
amicae, used to make appoint-
ments to meet his mistress (Egeria)
hy uagum cf. Liv. I. 19. 5 simulat

sibi cum dea Egeria congressus ’

nocturnos erse.

14. cophinus faenumque: ac-
cording to Friedlander, a basket
filled with hay in which to keep
the food tor the Sabbath, since the
Jew was forbidden to make a fire

on the Sabbath; Euodus xxxv. 3. 1

Cf. 11. 70 colentr'a faeno ovass The
common interpretation is: a bas-

ket for provisions and a bundle of Ι ’

hay for a bed. .

Camenae were four Italian pro· .
