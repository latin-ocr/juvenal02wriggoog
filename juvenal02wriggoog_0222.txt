planguntur nummi quam funera; nemo dolorem
lingit in hoc casu, vestem diducere summam ·
contentus, vexare oculos umore coacto:
ploratur lacrimis amissa pecunia veris.

sed si cuncta vides simili fora plena querella,

si decies lectis diversa parte tabellis

vana supervacui dicunt chirographa ligni,
arguit ipsorum quos littera gemmaque princeps

nos viles pulli nati infelicibus ovis?

festation of grief.

mam, to rfnd the top of his gar-
ment, and not tear it from top to
bottom. At the loss of a friend we
display the usual signs of mourn·
ing, though the grief is often
feigned. Cf. Mart. 1. 33. 1-.2
amissum non flet, cum sola est,
Gellia patrem st' quis adest, ius-
sae prosiliunt lacrimae. For the
loss of property the grief is sincere.
