iudice nemo nocens absolvitur, improba quamvis
gratia fallaci praetoris vicerit urna.

quid sentire putas omnes, Calvine, recenti

de scelere et fidei violatae crimine? sed nec

tam tenuis census tibi contigit ut mediocris
iacturae te mergat onus, nec rara videmus

quae pateris; casus multis hic cognitus ac iam
tritus et e medio fortunae ductus acervo.

ponamus nimios geinitus. flagrantior aequo

non debet dolor esse viri nec vulnere maior.

tu quamvis levium minimam exiguamque malorum
particulam vix ferre potes, spumantibus ardens
visceribus, sacrum tibi quod non reddat amicus 15
depositum? stupet haec qui iam post terga reliquit
sexaginta annos Fonteio consule natus?

4. praetoris urna: the urn into
which the ballots oi the iudices
were cast· Itis fallax, since it
gives an unjust verdict‚ either
because a false return of the votes
has been made by the praetor, or
because he has influenced the
iudices to make a wrong decision.
Each iudex was given three tab-
lets, inscribed with Α (absolvo), c
(condemno), Ν. 1„ (non liquet),
respectively, one oi which he cast
into the um.—vicerit: Intr. 43.

5. sentire‚feel. Juvenal makes
four suggestions calculated to af-
ford Calvinus some comfort: (rltbe
man’s conscience condemns him;
(2) you have the sympathy of
everybody; (3) your income is such
that you can stand the loss; and
(4) your misfortune is one that is
common.

8. iacturae, loss ; the throwing
overboard oi a part oi the cargo to
save tbe ship; cf. vs. 177, and 3.
125 n.

ro. tritus: an everyday affair.
—e medio acervo: te. it is only
an ordinary mistortune, not one
selected especially for you.

11. flagrantior aequo, more in·
tense than is reasonable ,· cf. 11. 88.

12. viri: ae. ot one worthy to be
called a man- vulnere maior:
ae. out of proportion to the loss.

14. spumantibus ardens vi·
secribus, avith ot'tals lotandsoam-
ing ; cf. 1. 4 5 siccum iecur ardeat
tra.

15. sacrum: because received
under oath and in the presence of
adeity.

17. Fonteio consule: L. Fon-
teius Capito, consul in nn. 67. If
Calvinus, now over 60, was bom
in his consulship, the satire was
written not earlier than 1²7 (Intr.
5). Another Fonteius Capito was
consul in nm. 59, but he is named
in the Fasti after his colleague, and
his name alone would not therefore
be taken to designate the year.
