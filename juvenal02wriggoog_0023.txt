INTRODUCTION xvii

some of the hnest passages are found in these books, and
Satires ro and 13 are generally considered worthy of being
ranked with the best. Moreover, most of the general char-
acteristics of Juvenal’s style are found as frequently in the
last two books asin the first three, and the tendency to
employ declamatlon which has been urged as a ground for
suspecting the genuineness of the later books, is by no means
absent from the earlier ones. The theory of Ribbeck, that,
with some exceptions, these books are not the work of
Juvenal but of an inferior writer who tried to imitate his
style, has not been received with favor. These satires
belong to a later period of the poet’s life, when his bitter
and intolerant spirit had been subdued by lapse of time,
and when his natural powers had lost their former vigor.

, 14. Juvenal had one standard with which he compared
the men and morals of his own age and found them want·
ing. This standard was the austere and simple life of the
ancient Romans. He despises foreigners both because they
are not Romans and because their influence has debased
the old national lif. This explains his disgust with the
Romans of his own day. They have hopelessly degenerated
from this ancient standard of simplicity and abstinence,
and the old Roman spirit has vanished. He is filled with

indignation at the rich nobleman who is given over to
³ gambling, forgery, and every vice, who drives on a public
road and spends whole nights in dissipation, because he
has lost the honest manhood of his ancestors. When he
condemns flattery, avarice‚ luxury, and gluttony, it often
seems to be not so much because they are wrong and mean,
as because they are characteristic vices of foreigners and
of the degenerare nobility.
