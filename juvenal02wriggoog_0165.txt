SATVRA X

ne placeat, curru servus portatur eodem.

da nunc et volucrem, sceptro quae surgit eburn0,

illinc cornicines, hinc praecedentia longi

agminis officia et niveos ad irena Quirites, 45

interdum et lacrimas, cum Fortunae ipse minaci

mandaret laqueum mediumque ostenderet unguem.
Ergo supervacua aut quae perniciosa petuntur? .
