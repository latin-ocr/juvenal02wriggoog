down to the eleventh century. Α11 these are classed together
under p. The variants include practically all that are pre·
served in other MSS. and some that are not elsewhere found.
In many places P is the only MS. that has kept the correct
reading, and its authority outweighs that of all the other
MSS. taken together.

20. All other MSS. which give the text in full are much
inferior and are put together in one class (ω). They are
valuable chiefly for the aid they furnish in restoring the
reading where P is illegible, or where it has become corrupt
from the errors of copyists In two of the MSS. of this class
this note is found: Legi ego Nireus Romae apud Seruium
magistrum ct emendavi. Nicaeus made this recension near
the, close of the fourth century.

Mr. E. O. Winstedt has recently collated a Bodleian MS.
of the eleventh century which contains thirty-six verses of
Satire 6, not found in any other known MS.¹ Ο1 these
verses, thirty-four are found after vs. 365, and two after
vs. 373. The'lack of the former passage in all other
existing MSS. may be due to the omission of a page by the
scribe of the archetype from which they have descended.
The value of this MS. has not yet been determined. If

- the new verses are genuine, it must have descended from a

MS. which antedated the archetype of P and ω, which had
lost them„and it may be necessary to recognize it as the
representative of a third class among the Juvenal MSS.

21. It has been generally believed that all the inferior
MSS. have come down from the recension of Nicaeus, but
that P goes back to a purer source. Biicheler, however,
thinks that 311 existing MSS. have come from a codex of the
Nicaean recension, containing many variants, and that
copyists followed sometimes the text and sometimes the
variants. The inferior MSS. do not transmit a text which
