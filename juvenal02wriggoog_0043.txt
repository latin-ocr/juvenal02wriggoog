Pleonasm

79. As if to give greater emphasis or to make a better
sounding phrase, two verbs, adjectives, or substantives are
often used where one would suffice:

(a) Verbs: 8. 37 cavebis et metues; 10. 29 moverat protuleratque.

(b) Adjectives: 3. 268 altu ac diversa ,· 8. 80 ambiguae incertaeque.

(c) Substantives: (ι) appellatives: 10. 113 reges ettyranni,· 4. 84 clade
et peste ; (z) proper names used to denote a class: 3. ²9 Artorius et
Catulus; ιο. 108 Crassos, Pompeios. Of these there are sometimes
three or more: 5109 quae mittebantur a Seneca, quae Piso bonus,
quae Cotta solebat largiri3 7. 94-95.

VERSIFICATION

80. Cassum. (a) The most frequent caesura in Juvenal’s
hexameter, as in that of every Roman poet, falls after the
thesis ot the third ioot (penthemimeral); as

3. 23 res hodie minor est ΙΙ here quam fuit atque eadem crae.

(b) A division oi the verse into three parts by caesuras
aiter the third hali foot (trithemimeral)‚ and after the
seventh (hephthemimeral) is comm0n; as

3. 215 ardet adhuc ΙΙ et iam accurrit ΙΙ qui marmora donet.

(c) The hephthemimeral caesura alone is rare, as is also
the combination oi the feminine caesura with the trithe-
mimeral :

14. 2 56 monstro voluptatem egregiam ΙΙ cui nulla theatra.
4. 120 in laevum ΙΙ conversus ΙΙ ab illi dextra iacebat.
