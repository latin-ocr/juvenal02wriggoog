INTRODUCTION xix

never inconsistent with nature (14. 3-21). For philosophy
he everywhere shows genuine respect, butas he despises ι
all forms of hypocrisy‚ so he detests shameless men who
pose as philosophers for their private ends.

17³ The first book represents Rome as it was under
Domitian, and the illustrations of this book, as well as
those ol the two following, are drawn mainly from that
period, and, to a less extent, from the reign oi Nero.
Juvenal could not openly attack prominent men of his
own day without great danger. Thisdanger he proposed
to avoid (ι. 170) by assailing tho'se already in their tombs.
He introduces Crispinus, Latinus, Massa, Carus, Veiento,
Paris, who had lived under Domitiam Tigellinus Lucusta,
from the time of Nero, and Narcissus, Posides and Pallas,
wealthy freedmen of Claudius. But while careful to avoid
giving offense to those who had it in their power to do him
injury, he does not hesitate to speak freely of those still
living, if they are under condemnation‚ as Marius Priscus,
or if they are of low rank, as Machaera, Vettius, Basilus, ·
and Paulus. When the same name in Martial and Juvenal
refers to one man, heis always one who was dead when
Juvenal wrote, or in a condition to do him no injury. In
case ot men of low rank he would have no reason for wishing
to withhold the real name. As a rule, any personal name in
the satires everywhere represents the same type of character.
Oi the literary men ol his day, Juvenal mentions Statius and
Quintilian, but is silent about Tacitus, Pliny, and Martial;
and Pliny, who boasts ol his wide acquaintance with men
interested in literature, nowhere in his letters makes any
reference to Juvenal.
