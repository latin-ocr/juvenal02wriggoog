can be clearly separated from that ol P. Moreover, all
the MSS. (except some that are still more incomplete)
stop abruptly in the middle ol a sentence with verse 60
Ι ol Satire 16. Therefore all existing MSS. must have corne
from one imperfect original which ended with that. verse.

the text. The Schedae Aroviensrs, or Aarau Fragments¹ con·
sist of five leaves which were rescued lrom the covers ol

manuscript rolls in the library of the town of Aarau in .
Switzerland, where they are still lrept. They contain about ’

425 verses from Satires 2, 3, 6, and 7. The codex from
which they were taken belonged to the same recension as
P, and closely resembled that MS. in external appearance.

. So lar as preserved, each page of the Aarau Fragments ἵ
agrees throughout with the corresponding page ol P, con-

taining precisely the same verses and the same scholia.
The Bobbio Palimpsest‚² N0. 5750 in the Vatican
library, consists of two leaves from a very old codex ol

- Juvenal and Persius. It contains fifty-two verses ol Juvenal Α

(14. 323-15· 43), with several scholia, and fifty-two verses
of Persius (r. 53-104).' By this fragment the reading of
P at 15. 27, Iunco, is confirmed.

The Florilegium Sangallense‚³ No. 870 ‘in the abbey
library ol St. Gall in Switzerland, contains 282 verses
- from Juvenal. This furnishes the new reading at 8.148,
mulio consul, which has been accepted by Biicheler and
· Mayor.

23. There are two sets of scholia. The scholia handed
down in the interior MSS. bear the name of Cornutus.
These are very full, but they contain little that is ol much
