1. We have very little trustworthy information about
· juvenal. The only sources from which any facts of his
life can be derived are: (ι) the ancient biographies; (2)
a dedicatory inscription; (3) three epigrams of Martial;
and (4) a lew passages in his own writings.

· 2. Numerous lives oi Juvenal (vitoe)¹ are preserved in
the manuscripts, at the beginning or end. These are not
independent biographus, but have all come from one origi-
nal, the best representative of which is the one iound on
an added leaf at the end oi the codex Pz'tlzoeonus, and writ-
ten by a later hand² These oitoc generally agree that
Juvenal was born at Aquinum, that he was the son or
foster-son of a wealthy freedmam that he practised decla·
mation till about middle life, and that he was banished in
consequence oi offense given toan actor by some verses
now contained in Satire 7. They differ chiefly as to the
time and place ol his banishment, and the circumstances
of his death. The statements regarding his birthplace‚ his
rhetorical studies, and the position of his father are not
inconsistent with anything found in the satireS, and have
probably been derived· from a reliable source.
