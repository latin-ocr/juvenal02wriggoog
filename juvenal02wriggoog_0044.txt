(d) The diaeresis at the end ol the fourth foot, called ,
the bucolic caesura, is more common in Juvenal than in
any other Latin poet. It is usually accompanied by the
penthemimeral caesura; as

3. 212 si magna Asturici ΙΙ cecidit domus ΙΙ horrida mater.

81. Elisihn is frequent, but never occurs at the end ol ,²
the verse.

Long vowels and diphthongs are often elided. Monosyllables very
rarely suffer elision; as 3. ²153 3593 ro.75‚ 217. In rr.161 there
are five cases of elision, and verses with two and three elided syllables ἵ r
are not infrequent.

82. Hiatus is allowed in eleven undisputed cases, always ’
at the principal caesura

The hiatus occurs once after the second thesis, seven times after
the third, and three times after the fourth ; as

12. 36 testiculi ; adeo medicatum intellegit inguen.
3. 70 hic Andro, ille Sam0‚ hic Trallibus aut Alabandis.
5. 158 quis melior plorante gula? ergo omnia fiunt.

83. Spondaic Verres. There are thirty-three spondaic lines in
Juvenal. One (5. 38) closes with three spondees; in all the others ¹
the fourth foot is a dactyl. One (3. 273) ends with a monosyllable,
and fifteen with a trisyllable. In seventeen the fifth and sixth feet are
contained in a quadrisyllable.

PROSODY

84. Final Syllables. Final i ol mz'lii', tibi, sibi is long only
when the ictus falls upon it. The same is true of final o

of verbs and adverbs, and ol substantivas of the third
deelension.
Ergo (3281) is an exception. Final o is made short in vigilando ,

(3. ²3²)· Final i of ubi and ibi is short in the simple words, but long in
the compounds ubique and ibidem.

Ι 85. Gmitives in -ius The vowel i ol alteri'us is by i
necessity short in dactylic verse. In other genitives in ius, ¹
excepting illius 6. 608, it is alwaysv long.
