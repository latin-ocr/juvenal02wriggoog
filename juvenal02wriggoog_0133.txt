SATVRA VII

ut totiens illum pater audiat ?' ,haec alii sex
vel plures uno conclamant ore sophistae

et veras agitant lites raptore relicto}

fusa venena silent, malus ingratusque maritus

et quae iam veteres sanant mortaria caecos.

ergo sibi dabit ipse rudem, si nostra movebunt
consilia, et vitae diversum iter ingredietur,

ad pugnam qui rhetorica descendit ab umbra

summula ne pereat qua vilis tessera venit

frumenti. quippe haec merces lautissima. tempta Ῑ75
Chrysogonus quanti doceat vel Pollio quanti

lautorum pueros: artem scindes Theodori.

166. totiens: ie. as often as Ι
have done.

167. sophistae: rhetores.

168. veras lites, real lawsuits,
entered upon in order to collect
their sees—relicto: they aban·
don lor the time their fictitious
cases, of which vss. 168-170 con-
tain examples. These may have
been based on the stories of Paris,
Medea, Jason, and Pelias.

170. veteres caecos, those long
blind ,· lntr. 57. —- mortaria: intr.

'171. sibi: see intr. 84.-ru-
dem: cf. Hor. Ep. Ι. 1. 2. When
a gladiator was discharged from
service he received the rude's, a
wooden sword. · Juvenal says the
rhetorician who needs to go to law
to get his paltryfee had better give
up his profession altogether and
turn to some other mode oi life.

173. ad pugnam: ie. to a con-
test in the courts.— rhetorica ab
umbra, from his scholastic seclu-
se‘on,· cf. vs. 8 Pieria in umbra.

174· ne pereat: dependingupon
descendit. -tessera frumenti,
grain ticket. Citizens at Rome,

except senators, were furnished
monthly with a certain amount ol
grain (probably five modii each) by
the state, sometimes gratuitously,
but generally at a price much below
the market value. This was sup-
plied without cost to the poor
citizens, who received tickets called
tesserae frumentariae, with which
they could get the grain without
payment. A citizen might sell his
ticket. The value would be small,
but the rhetorician gets hardly
enough to purchase one. -venit,
is sold, ie. by the person entitled
to receive it.

17 5. tempta: ie. look into the
matter and see; an imperative in
the protasis oi a conditional sen-
tence, cf. 1. 155 11. ,

176. Chrysogonus: 6. 74.-
Pollio: 6. 423; Mart. lV. 61. 9.
Both were musicians. The music
teacher is much better paid than
the rhetorician3 cf. Mart. V. 56. 9.

177. artem, text-book (on rheto-
ric).-scindes‚ and you will
teor etp-Theodori: an eminent
Greek rhetorician oi the time of
Augustus3 Quint. ΙΙΙ. 1.17.
