208 · IVVENALIS ·

alterius populi rapienda occasio cunctis

visa inimicorum primoribus ac ducibuS, ne .

laetum hilaremque diem, ne magnae gaudia cenae
sentirent positis ad templa et compita mensis · ·
pervigilique tom, quem nocte ac luce iacentem

septimus interdum sol invenit. horrida sane

Aegyptos sed luxuria, quantum ipse notavi, 45
barbara famoso non cedit turba Canopo

adde quod et facilis victoria de madidis et

blaesis atque mero titubantibus. inde virorum

saltatus nigro tibicine, qualiacumque

unguenta et flores multaeque in fronte coronae: 50
hinc ieiunum odium. sed iurgia prima sonare

incipiunt animis ardentibus; haec tuba rixae.

39. alterius populi: probably
the Ombites since Ombi was super
maenia Capti (vs. 28), and Tentyra
was not. It appears als0, from
verses 75-76, that the Ombites
. were the people which celebrated
the festal period, and that the Ten·

Egypt with Canopus, which was a
part of Egypt. But Canopus con-
tained a larger element of for·
eigners, and, though in Egypt,
was essentially a foreign city.
Resides, Juvenal had Upper Egypt
in mind when he wrote: in profli-

tyrites attached them. But the gaeytbe barbarian crowd does not

reading ol vs. 75 is uncertain.

4²· positis ad compita mensis :
cf. Mela I. 57 (speaking of the
Egyptians) cibaspalam et extra tecta
sua capiunt-compita, tlee crass·
wa s. ·

bg pervigili: occupied all night
long; cf. 8. 158 pervtgiles popinas,
and 3. 275.—tor0: i.e. on which
the revelers reclined at the feast.

44. horrida sane Aegyptos,
Egypt is unceia'lizea', ta be sure.

45. quantum ipse notavi: the
statement in the vitae that Juvenal
was sent to Egypt is perhaps based
on this expression, Intr. 11.

46. Canopo: near Alexandria,
noted for its profligacy; 1. 26 n.
It seems urmatural to contrast

fall behind notariaus Canopus.

47. adde quod: cf. 14. 114.—
madidis: cf. 6. 297 madidum
Tarentum.

48. inde: ie. on the side of the
Ombites.

49. qualiacumque, such astbey
were.

50. in fronte coronae: Intr. 33.

51· hinc ieiunum odium: the
Tentyrites were driven on by ha·
tred and hunger. —iurgia prima :
cf. 5. 26 iurgia proludunt.

5²· haec tuba: ie. this insult-
ing language was the trumpet call
to a general combat; cf. 3. 288
miserae prooemia rinae. They be·

then they fight with stones ; finally
