IVVENALIS

et melior vicina seges, mercaris et hanc et
arbusta et densa montem qui canet oliva.

quorum si pretio dominus non vincitur ullo,

Ῑ45 ,

nocte boves macri lassoque famelica collo

iumenta ad virides huius mittentur aristas,

nec prius inde domum quam tota novalia saevos

in ventres abeant, ut credas falcibus actum.

dicere vix possis quam multi talia plorent

et quot venales iniuria iecerit agros.

sed qui sermones, quam foedae bucina lamae!

‘quid nocet haec 3’ inquit ‘tunicam mihi malo lupini
quam si me toto laudet vicinia pago

exigui ruris paucissima farra secantem'

Ι55

scilicet et morbis et debilitate carebis

144· arbusta, vineyards in
which the vines were trained on
trees—qui canet oliva: the
leaves of the ohve are grayish-
green on the upper side, and
hoary on the under side.

145· quorum: introducing an
adversative sentence: But if their
owner cannot be induced to sell,
you proceed to injure his property,
that it may seem to him less de·
sirable. Your cattle get into his
field at night. They are lean
(macri), half starved (famelica),
and weary from the day’s work
(lasso), and therefore so ravenous
(saevos) that they leave nothing.

148. novalia, tlregmoingcrop.

151· venales fecerit: tie. has
brought into the market. It does
not follow irom this that there
were not strict laws among the
Romans for the punishment of
such injuries‚ but the poor farmer
is at a great disadvantage if he
attempts to settle a dispute with a
rich and poweriul neighbor by

legal process, and he naturally
prefers to submit to imposition;
cf. Hor. C. 11. 18. 23⁴2ss quid quod
usque proximos revellis agri ler-
minos et ultra limites clientium

' salis avarus? pellitur paternos in

sinu serens deos et uxor et vir
sordidosque nator.

15²· sed qui sermones: ci.
10. 88 hi sermones tunc de Seiano ‚·
but, you say, public opinion will
condemn the rich man for this
base treatment ot a weak neigh-
bor. He replies: ‘Public opinion
cannot harm me. Ido not desire
the good opinion oi my neighbors
if 1 must be poor in order to gain
it.' .

¹53· tunicam malo lupini
quam, I worcld rather'have a bean
pod than, like our ‘I don't care a
straw for ’ς ct. Stat. Silo. IV. 9. 30
bulborum tunicae.

155. paucissima farra, a scanty
rrop ofspelt.

156. scilicet, of course, intro-
ducing an ironical sentence.
