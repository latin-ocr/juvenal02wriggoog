INTRODUCTION

Diminutives

7²· Diminutives came into the literature from the popu·
lar speech, and are common in those writers who have
borrowed freely from the language of everyday tite. They
are especially frequent in comedy and satire.

Ι. Sussraurrvus

73. (a) Α large proportion of the diminutive substantives in Juvenal

have lost their diminutive signification, and hardly differ in meaning
from the primitives from which they were formed; as 3. 161 sarcinulae
(⁴ the wiie’s fortune 'l = sarcinae, which is used in the same sense in
Martial 11. 11.8; 10. 82 fornacula (to which the adjective magna is
joined) :forma ; 1. 160 labellum = labrum ; 3. 28 bacillum = baculum.

(b) In a few cases the diminutive has come to have a special mean-
ing which the primitive does not have; as 1.95 sportula (⁶ dole ')
from sporta, ‘basket’3 8.5 auricula (the external ear) from auris,
the organ of hearing; 10.134 buccula (cheek-piece of a helmet) from
bucco, ‘cheek.'

(c) Many are pure diminutives, denoting that objects are small in
size or quantity ; as rr. 79 holuscula (bolus), ‘ a few vegetables ’ς 3. 102
agniculus (agnis), ‘a little fire ’ς 15· 79 porticulo (pars), ⁶ a small part!

Diminutives are also used to express ι .

(d) Fondness or endearment: 11.143 n'runculus (tiro), of a pet
slave3 11.153 casula (casa) of the cottage where one lived as a child.

(e) Pity, on account of one's lot: 3. 253 seruulus, ‘poor little slave’
(who has so much to carry).

(s) Contempt‚ because the object is of inferior character or quality,
or is so exceedingly small ε 4. 98 fraterculus, ‘low-bom brother’3 7.119
petasunculus, ‘mean little ham’3 1. 40 unciolam, ‘a paltry twelfth.’

(g) Occasionally the sentence shows that a diminutive is employed
to give a comio coloring to the expression: ro. 117 vernula, ‘ pigmy·
slave '; 13. 40 virguncula, ‘girlgoddess'

ΙΙ. AuJucrrvss.

from their primitives: 11. ¹35 rancidulus (= rancidus) ; 1 3. 213 misellus
(= miser).
