SATVRA III

in vallem Egeriae descendimus et speluncas

dissimiles veris. Qnt-opraesentius esset

nurnQaquis, viridi si margine eluderet undas ·

› herba nec ingenuum violarent marmora tolum. zo

H ic tunc Vmbricius ‘quando artibus’ inquit ‘honestis
nullus in urbe locus, nulla emolumenta laborum, ’
[qslrodie minor est here quarn fuit, atque eadem cras
deteret exiguis Μ, proponimus illuc
ire, fatigatasubi Daedalus exuit alas, 2 5
dum nova canities, d'um prima et recta senectus,
dum superest Lachesi quod torqueat, et pedibus me
porto meis nullo dextram subeunte bacillo,
cedamus patria. vivant Artorius istic

phetic nymphs‚ of whom Egeria
wasone.

18. dissimiles veris: not like
natural caves-verissume. 30.

, -praesentius, more real ,· cf.

11. 111 templorum maiestas prae-
sentior. We can easily imagine
that a nymph dwells by a stream
with natural banks, but not by
one adorned with slabs ol mar-
ble.

20. violarent, desacrata cf. 11.
116 nullo violatus Iuppiter auro.

21-57. The discourseof Umbri·
cius, which occupies the rest of
the satire, begins with an expres-
sion of his determination to leave
Rome while he still retains his
bodily vigor, since only dishonor-
able men can succeed there.

21. artibus honestis : tor hon·
orable occupations there is no
place. In vss. 126—1 30 and roo-162
he suggests some of the opportu-
nities which he considers honorable
and would be willing to accept.

23. eadem (sc. res) cras. etc,
and this will also wear away some-

thing tomorrow from the scanty
sum that now remains.

²5· Daedalus: according to
the tradition which Vergil followed,
Daedalus in his flight from Crete
landed at Cumae, and consecrated
his wings to Apollo; Aen¹ VI. 14-
192’6.1 ¹lrttriv6a6ccainities : he has a few
gray hairs, and (prima senectus)
attenuarant w -

t

(recta) he is not yet bowed with ,

age and (nullo bacillo) needs no
staff. On the anaphora, see lntr.
zor.

27. quod torqueat: here the
Fates are represented as spinning
the thread of life as long as lite
continues. In Hor. Epod. 13· 15
the thread of Achilles' life has
already been spun at his birth, and
his destiny fixed.

28. bacillo: Intr. 73 a.

²9· Artorius, Catulus: any men
who try to gain wealth and promi·
nence by dishonorable means;
Intr. 64 α.
