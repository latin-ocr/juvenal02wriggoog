188 IVVENALIS

quo loquor, egregium populus putat adquirendi 115
artificem ; quippe his crescunt patrimonia fabris,

sed crescunt quocumque modo, maioraque fiunt

incude adsidua semperque ardente camino.

et pater ergo animi felices credit avaros; ,
qui miratur opes, qui nulla exempla beati 120 ’
pauperis esse putat, iuvenes hortatur ut illa l
ire via pergant et eidem incumbere sectae.

sunt quaedam vitiorum elementa: his protinus illos
inbuit et cogit minimas ediscere sordes;

mox adquirendi docet insatiabile votum.

servorum ventres modio castigat iniquo
ipse quoque esuriens, neque enim omnia sustinet

126. modio iniquo: cf. Liv. V.
