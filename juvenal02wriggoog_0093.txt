SATVRA IV

SATVRA lV

Ecce iterum Crispinus et est mihi saepe vocandus
ad partes, monstrum nulla virtute redemptum

a vitiis, aegrae solaque libidine fortes

Ι deliciae; viduas tantum spernatur adulter.

= quid refert igitur quantis iumenta fatiget
porticibus quanta nemorum vectetur in umbra,

’ iugera quot vicina foro, quas emerit aedes?

nemo malus felix, minime corruptor et idern
incestus, curn quo nuper vittata iacebat

IV. Tiru Counciu or Dour-
TIAN. -The satire consists of two
parts: (ι) The denunciation ot
Crispinus (1-33); (2) the meeting
of the council oi Domitian to de-
liberate on the question, what is

³ to be done with a huge turbot

which has been presented to the
emperor (37-154). The first part
has very little to do with the sec·

‚ ond, and Ribbeck sets it aside as

spurious. Itis more likely, how·
ever, that Juvenal wrote it for a
different purpose, and afterward
prefixed it here as an introduction.
Lewis suggests that it may have
been the beginning of a poem on
Crispinus which was never com-
pleted. The satire was published

‚K after Domitian’s death (vss.153-

154), ie. after nn. 96.
With the‘Councilof theTurbot’
should be compared the funereal

banquet described by Dio Cassius,

67¹1-9e7. The upstart Crispinus
purchased a mullet for 6000 ses·

3 tereos, and that too for his own

eating.

r. iterum: this can hardly re-
fer to 1. 26-29, since Satire 1 is
an introduction and probably writ-

ten later than the other satires of
this hook. The reference may be
to some poem not preserved.—
iterum Crispinus: cf. Plin. Ep.
V. 20. 1 iterum Bithyni. -vocam
dus ad partes: must be sum-
moned upon the stage to play his
part After the introduction Cris-
pinus has a very unimportant part
in this satire (vss. 108-109)‚ and
is mentioned elsewhere by juvenal
only in r. 26-29.

2. nulla virtute, not a single
manly quality.

4. deliciae, a voluptuary.-vi-
duas tantum, single women enlyr.

6. porticibus: Mart. Xll. 57.
²3 intre limen clusus essedo cursus.
In 7. 178—180 the lord takes a drive
in his porticus in rainy weather.
-vectetur: ie in the lectica.

7. vicina loro: where land
would naturally bring an exorbi-
tant price.

9. curn quo: Intr.48.—vittata
sacerdos: ie. a vestal. The vitta
was a rihbon or tillet which bound
the infiela round the forehead‚ its
ends hanging down at the sides
of the head. lt was worn by
priests and vestals, and by victims;
cf. Lucr. 1. 87 sq.
