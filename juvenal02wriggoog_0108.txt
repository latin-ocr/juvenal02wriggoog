Heliadum crustas et inaequales berullo ’

Virro tenet phialas: tibi non committitur aurum,
vel siquando datur, custos adfixus ibidem, ' 40
qui numeret gemmas ungues observet acutos.
da veniam, praeclara illi laudatur iaspis;

narn Virro, ut multi, gemmas ad pocula transfert
adigitis, quas in vaginae fronte solebat

ponere zelotypo iuvenis praelatus Iarbae.

tu Beneventani sutoris nomen habentem
siccabis calicem nasorum quattuor ac iarn, ,
quassatum et rupto poscentem sulpura vitro.

sulphur matches for broken glass,
and in Mart. X. 3. 4 it is broken
Vatinian cups that are thus taken

. in erchange.
