6. The exact date of Juvenal's birth is unknown.
According to the tradition of the vitae he practised J
declamation till about middle lile, and did not give his 1
satires to the public till somewhat later. The earliest
seem to be the productions of a man of maturity and
experience. A short υἱέα ¹ attached to a MS. of the fifteenth
century, in the library of the Barberini palace at Rome, .
places his birth ·in the consulship of Claudius Nero and
L. Antistius, ie. in the year 55. This biography bears

’ evidence of being a late production and may not go back
to an authentic source, but the date of birth given in it
cannot be far wrong. Friedl‘a'nder thinks that Juvenal
did not begin to write before about 110, and that he was
born not long before or not long alter 60. Aquinum has
been generally accepted as his birthplace. Umbricius
(3. 319), addressing Juvenal, uses the expression tuo Aquino.
This may mean only that Juvenal was fond of the place J
and often visited it,² but the tablet put up by the poet ¹
was found at Aquinum, and the vitae generally agree that
he was born there.
