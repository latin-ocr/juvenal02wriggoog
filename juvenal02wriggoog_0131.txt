SATVRA VII

oct0, decem comites, an post te sella, togati
ante pedes. ideo conducta Paulus agebat
sardonyche, atque ideo pluris quam Gallus agebat,

quis bene dicentem Basilum ierat? accipiat te
Gallia vel potius nutricula causidicorum
Africa, si placuit mercedem ponere linguae.
Declamare doces? oferrea pectora Vetti, 150 ⁵
cum perimit saevos classis numerosa tyrannos.
nam quaecumque sedens modo legerat, haec eadem

stans

perferet atque eadem cantabit versibus isd'em3
