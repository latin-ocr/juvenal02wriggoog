x INTRODUCTION

3. Α tablet¹.dedicated to Ceres by some person whose ¹
name was Juvenal was found at Aquinum. The original
‚ stone is now lost, and the inscription, defective in some
parte, is preserved by copies only. As the praenomen of
the person who made the dedication is wanting, it is uncer-
tain whether the tablet was put up by the poet or by some
other member of his family. But as it was discovered at
Aquinum, which Juvenal often visited (3. 319), and was
consecrated to Ceres, whom he honored (3. 320) and every-
where speaks of with respect (14. 2193 15. 141), and that
evidently not long after the death of Vespasian; and more-
over since the tablet contains nothing that contradicts what

is known about Juvenal from other sources, it is a reasonable · ,
Ἴ inference that the Juvenal of the inscription is the poet. If ’
this be admitted, we learn from this source that, at the time ,

when the dedication was made, Juvenal had served as tribune
of a Dalmatian cohort, had been duumvir qm'nquennalis at
Aquinum, and was flumen of the deified Vespasian.

4. The references to Juvenal in the epigrams of Martial²
show that the two poets were friends, and that in or shortly
before the years 92 and 101 Juvenal was living in Rome,
where at the latter date he was busily engaged in the weari-
some duties of a client. Martial (VII. 91. ι) calls him sacun-
dus, an epithet probably given to him in recognition of his
rhetorical skill, since it is unlikely that he had become
known as a poet four years before the death of Domitian.

5. From his own writings the period to which his literary
career belongs can be approximately fixed. The sixteen

satires are divided into five books, and it is quite certain ἵ

that the books are arranged in the order of their publica-
tion. Book Ι (Satires 1-5) contains mention of the con-
quest of the Orcades by Agricola in 84 (2. 161), of the death
