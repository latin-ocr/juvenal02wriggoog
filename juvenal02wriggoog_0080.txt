his will (cf. 1. 145 n), but the rich

do not leave their property to the
poor. '¹

162. in consilio: ie. as assessor
or legal adviser to a magistrate
that had to make judicial deci-
sions, as the praetor and the prae-
fectus urbi. The poor man is not
called in to give advice even to a
police magistrate. There is no
other allusion to an assessor of an
aedile. '

163. olim, long ago.

164. emergunt: sc. from pov-
erty. It is not easy for the poor to
rise anywhere, but at Rome the
attempt is more difficult, because
there everything costs an extrava-
gant price. Though be has only a
wretched lodging the poor citizen
must keep slaves, use silver table-
ware and appear in public in the
toga. Horace, a simple bachelon
had three slaves to wait on him at
dinner; S. Ι. 6. 116.

166. magno: on the anaphora,
see Intr. 26 b, and on the omission
of the verb, Intr. 54.

170. Veneto :Venetia produced
wool of third rate quality; Mart.
XIV. 155. 2.—duro: coarse and
therefore cheap. — cucullo: the

cucullus was sometimes fastened to
the lacerna or paenula, and some-
times was worn as a separate arti-
cle of dress, being made large
enough to cover the head and ·
upper part oi the body; cucullo
hasbeen thought by some inap
propriate here, since Juvenal has
just been speaking of food and
dishes, but the verse is to be con-
nected closely with the following.

'If you live among the Marsi you

may wear a coarse mantle and dis·
pense altogether with the toga, as
people generally do in the country.
There even the officials on a holi-
day wear nothing better than white
tunics.

172. nemo togam sumit: the
toga was expensive and inconve-
nient‚anddiscardedwheupossible;
cf. 11. ²04· Pliny (Ep. V. 6. 45)
mentions'among the advantages
oi his Tuscan villa nulla necessitas
togae. In Martial's home at Bil-
bilis tgnota est toga (XII. 18. 17).
One of the conditions of a happy
life (Mart. X. 47. 5) is toga rara.
—nisi mortuus: the dead body
was arrayed in the toga; cf. Mart.
IX. 57. 8 pallens toga mortui tri·
bulis. ’
