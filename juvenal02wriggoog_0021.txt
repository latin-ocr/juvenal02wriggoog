INTRODUCTION xv

enoe of histriones in securing appointments in the army,
composed against Paris, an actor. According to the vita
of the codex Pithoeanus these verses were not at first pub-
lished, but being afterwards inserted in his writings (7. 90-
92) they were thought to be directed¹ against an actor ol the
day whose friends were receiving promotion, and in conse-
quence Juvenal was sent at the age of eighty, under the form
of a military command, to the extremity of Egypt, where he
soon died. Upon what foundation any part ol this story rests,
it is impossible to say. It must have been well known in the
fifth century, since Sidonius Apollinaris a Christian writer
ol that time, thought Juvenal sufficiently described by the
expression “irati histrionis exsul.” 'Paris on whom the
verses are said to have been written, was a celebrated actor
under Domitian, and died in 83. As Satire 7 was pub·
lished in Hadrian's reign, the actor who is said to have,
been offended by them at the time ot their publication
must have lived in the reign of that emperor; and follow·
ing this account we must believe that Juvenal in his old
age was sent to a remote military post as prefect of a
cohort by Hadrian. An emperor who banished for his
sarcastic criticism and afterwards put to death the archi-
tect who had built Trajan's lorum, may have banished .
Juvenal for a slight offense given even in a satire which
begins with a flattering compliment to himsell; but it is =
highly improbable that a man too old lor service should
have been intrusted with an important military command.
lt the banishment took this form, it is lar more likely that
it occurred under Domitian, and it has been suggested that
Juvenal's bitterness against Crispinus would be explained

it we suppose that he was the instrument ol its execution. Ἴ
The whole story does not seem like an invention. There
is nothing in the satires to have suggested it, though the
statement that he was sent to Egypt may have been an
