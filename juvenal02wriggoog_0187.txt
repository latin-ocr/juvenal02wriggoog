5. de Rutilo, are talking aheni
Rutilus ; lntr. 50.
6. sufficiunt galeae: ie. fit

÷ him for military service ; cf. 7. 33

aetas patiens cassides atque lagonis ,·
and 8. 169 maturus hello. - fertur,
is impellea' by his own nature.
Freemen often became gladiators
after they had squandered their
fortunes. It would seem, from
this passage, that the tribune had
the right to intercede to annul the
agreement of a citizen with a la-¹
nista, and possibly the right, in
some cases, to compel him to
make such agreement.

l: titini}lintizi..
-regia verba: the gladiator took
a solemn oath to submit to any-
thing which the lanista might re-
quire-lanistae: 3. 158.

10. macelli: the general mar-
ket where provisions of all sorts
were offered ior sale; ci. Ter.
Eun. 255-257. The Macellum
Liviae had been built by Augustus
on the Esquiline, and the Macel-
lum Magnum by Nero on the

Caelian, —perhaps the site of the
circular church of St. Stephen.

11. vivendi eausa: 8. 84 n.

12. egregius: comparative of
the adverb egregie. The one most
deeply involved in debt spends
most upon his dinner.

13. casurus (Intr. 41 b) :like an
old building sure to fall, through
the cracked walls ot which the light
already shines3 cf. 3. 196 pendente
ruina. The future participle is
connected by et with the adjective
miserrimus, and both agree with
the implied subject of cenat.

14. interea: so long as the
final crash is delayed.—gustus‚
‹inimice-elementa omnia: i.e.
air, water, land.

15· animo, desire.

16. ementur,aretobepurckased;
the delight is in anticipation rather
than in actual enjoyment.

17. haud difficile est: ie. they
have no scruple about parting with
family plate or even a mother’s
image; ef. 3. 31 quis facile est.—
perituram: which they will soon
squander; Intr. 41 a.
